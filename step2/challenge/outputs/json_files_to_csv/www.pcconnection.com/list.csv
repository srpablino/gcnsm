Buy Joy Factory Tournez Wall MagConnect for iPad Stands & Mounts - AV MMA105 today at PC Connection|1.60 lb(s)||||Black||"Lightweight Strength:
MagConnect mounts are built of high-quality carbon fiber arms. This advanced material is surprisingly lightweight yet incredibly strong. The powerful combination of carbon fiber with carefully designed joints produces mounts that are both easy to maneuver and sturdy to use.
Spherical Joints:
MagConnect mounts come equipped with spherical joints for ultimate customizability. The included MagConnect iPad holder can be swiveled 360° to easily transition from portrait to landscape mode without removing it from the mount. And the sturdy carbon fiber arms can also be adjusted into infinite configurations providing you with the perfect angle every time.
Magnetic Personality:
The MagConnect locking mechanism is the next step in the evolution of mobile mounts. The technology is advanced, but using it is quite simple. First, the iPad is secured into a hard-shell case equipped with a powerful magnet. When the case is attached to a compatible product, another magnet instantly interlocks your MagConnect shell with a receiver, while a precision screw tightens for a secure fit.
Beautiful On and Off its Pedestal:
When your iPad is not mounted, you can carry it in style. The MagConnect hard-shell case is textured for stunning look and feel and comes complete with a low-profile cap to cover the magnetic connector. The included case is designed to work seamlessly the Apple Smart Cover, or for greater protection pair it with our Folio360 III, the most customizable iPad case anywhere.

"Buy Planar 55"" LX55HD-L Full LED-LCD Monitor with ERO, Black Monitors - Large-Format LED-LCD 997-7117-00 today at PC Connection"|60.00 lb(s)|||450 nit(s)|Black||"Unique Architecture and Benefits by Design:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System was architected and developed by video wall industry experts in a way that specifically addresses the challenges faced by all video wall installations: mounting and alignment, reliability and extended operation, service and maintenance access and simple, effective image processing and management. At the heart of the Clarity Matrix architecture is a distributed design that takes heat, complexity and unreliability out from behind the LCD panel and replaces it with a centrally located, easily accessible and highly reliable rackmounted system.
EasyAxis Mounting System:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System includes the EasyAxis mounting system. The EasyAxis mounting system is designed to be attached to a wall, used with optional free-standing bases or secured overhead in a flying configuration. The single mount supports all these configurations. When used in wall-mount
configuration, horizontal and vertical connection brackets ensure that each mount is perfectly spaced from its neighbor in the video wall. The mount system also incorporates a service mode to accommodate front and rear in-wall repair of any LCD module in the video wall. EasyAxis mounts are designed to facilitate the thinnest profile LCD video wall in the market. The combination of the mount plus the Clarity Matrix LCD Modules “blade” design result in video walls that measure a mere 3.6 inches in depth, screen-to-wall, as opposed to other designs that require 60% more clearance.
Precise Panel Alignment:
Clarity Matrix LCD modules incorporate a single simple interface board designed to distribute off-board power, video and control signals to the LCD panel keeping depth, weight, heat and points of potential failure to an unprecedented minimum. The LCD blade-style module incorporates a bracket that is perfectly paired with the EasyAxis mount. The LCD module includes EasyAxis adjustment cams that facilitate precise 6-axis alignment ensuring uniform, minimized image-to-image gap. The lighter design of the Clarity Matrix LCD module means that handling, installation, alignment and service are all easier to accomplish.
24x7 Operation and Simplified Maintenance:
The unique Clarity Matrix architecture provides for 24x7 operation with optimized thermal design, high-MTBF components and redundant power supply option. Because of the streamlined design of the Clarity Matrix LCD modules, fewer repairs are required at the panel itself. When the panels do need to be accessed or removed, this can be accomplished without removing other panels in the wall. Starting at the top of the wall, panels can be pulled up and out into Service Mode, allowing the panel below to be accessed. Also built into each Clarity Matrix LCD display are service and troubleshooting aids that minimize downtime in the event of a failure. Power, backlight and fan monitoring are all built into Clarity Matrix to provide failure notification. Clarity WallNet enables health and status monitoring over a customer network to proactively provide health status or send an email or text message to a service technician alerting them of a failure.
Redundant Power Supply:
The rack-mount video processing and power supply units each support 4 LCD modules, incorporate their own cooling and make configuration, maintenance and upgrades easily accessible and unobtrusive to the video wall itself. For even further reliability, the Clarity Matrix power supply unit includes an n+1 redundant design so if any one power supply in the unit fails, the remaining 4 will continue to power 4 LCD’s with uninterrupted operation.
Flexible Video Processing:
Clarity Matrix supports a wide range of processing options to display sources on the video wall. Planar’s Big Picture Plus processing is built into Clarity Matrix and allows sources to be scaled across the entire video wall or any section of the video wall. To simplify the set-up process of Big Picture Plus, Clarity Matrix has position sensors built in the LCD that determine where it is located within the array and scale the sources across the video wall automatically. Big Picture Plus processing also allows for ultra-high resolution dual link DVI signals to be input and spread over multiple displays at native resolution. For more complex configurations, Clarity Matrix supports all leading image processing and digital signage software solutions including Planar’s Indisys image processing.
Clarity Matrix with ERO:
Clarity Matrix with ERO features a glass front to provide increased ruggedness and optical performance for applications in public spaces or interactive touch. The glass surface is optically bonded to the front of the LCD with a proprietary construction and technique which maintains the narrow bezel spacing and creates a continuous surface when tiled together in a video wall. Clarity Matrix with ERO also provides improved optical performance in high ambient light by providing additional ambient light rejection and increased contrast."||DVI (Dual Link)|DVI|Display, documentation|3500:1||Digital Visual Interface (DVI)||55 in|['LED-backlit', 'LCD']|Widescreen||||||||||1920 x 1080|||||"(2) Dual-Link DVI (in, out)

"Buy Planar 46"" LX46HD-L Full LED-LCD Monitor with ERO, Black Monitors - Large-Format LED-LCD 997-7113-00 today at PC Connection"|58.00 lb(s)|||450 nit(s)|Black||"Unique Architecture and Benefits by Design:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System was architected and developed by video wall industry experts in a way that specifically addresses the challenges faced by all video wall installations: mounting and alignment, reliability and extended operation, service and maintenance access and simple, effective image processing and management. At the heart of the Clarity Matrix architecture is a distributed design that takes heat, complexity and unreliability out from behind the LCD panel and replaces it with a centrally located, easily accessible and highly reliable rackmounted system.
EasyAxis Mounting System:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System includes the EasyAxis mounting system. The EasyAxis mounting system is designed to be attached to a wall, used with optional free-standing bases or secured overhead in a flying configuration. The single mount supports all these configurations. When used in wall-mount
configuration, horizontal and vertical connection brackets ensure that each mount is perfectly spaced from its neighbor in the video wall. The mount system also incorporates a service mode to accommodate front and rear in-wall repair of any LCD module in the video wall. EasyAxis mounts are designed to facilitate the thinnest profile LCD video wall in the market. The combination of the mount plus the Clarity Matrix LCD Modules “blade” design result in video walls that measure a mere 3.6 inches in depth, screen-to-wall, as opposed to other designs that require 60% more clearance.
Precise Panel Alignment:
Clarity Matrix LCD modules incorporate a single simple interface board designed to distribute off-board power, video and control signals to the LCD panel keeping depth, weight, heat and points of potential failure to an unprecedented minimum. The LCD blade-style module incorporates a bracket that is perfectly paired with the EasyAxis mount. The LCD module includes EasyAxis adjustment cams that facilitate precise 6-axis alignment ensuring uniform, minimized image-to-image gap. The lighter design of the Clarity Matrix LCD module means that handling, installation, alignment and service are all easier to accomplish.
24x7 Operation and Simplified Maintenance:
The unique Clarity Matrix architecture provides for 24x7 operation with optimized thermal design, high-MTBF components and redundant power supply option. Because of the streamlined design of the Clarity Matrix LCD modules, fewer repairs are required at the panel itself. When the panels do need to be accessed or removed, this can be accomplished without removing other panels in the wall. Starting at the top of the wall, panels can be pulled up and out into Service Mode, allowing the panel below to be accessed. Also built into each Clarity Matrix LCD display are service and troubleshooting aids that minimize downtime in the event of a failure. Power, backlight and fan monitoring are all built into Clarity Matrix to provide failure notification. Clarity WallNet enables health and status monitoring over a customer network to proactively provide health status or send an email or text message to a service technician alerting them of a failure.
Redundant Power Supply:
The rack-mount video processing and power supply units each support 4 LCD modules, incorporate their own cooling and make configuration, maintenance and upgrades easily accessible and unobtrusive to the video wall itself. For even further reliability, the Clarity Matrix power supply unit includes an n+1 redundant design so if any one power supply in the unit fails, the remaining 4 will continue to power 4 LCD’s with uninterrupted operation.
Flexible Video Processing:
Clarity Matrix supports a wide range of processing options to display sources on the video wall. Planar’s Big Picture Plus processing is built into Clarity Matrix and allows sources to be scaled across the entire video wall or any section of the video wall. To simplify the set-up process of Big Picture Plus, Clarity Matrix has position sensors built in the LCD that determine where it is located within the array and scale the sources across the video wall automatically. Big Picture Plus processing also allows for ultra-high resolution dual link DVI signals to be input and spread over multiple displays at native resolution. For more complex configurations, Clarity Matrix supports all leading image processing and digital signage software solutions including Planar’s Indisys image processing.
Clarity Matrix with ERO:
Clarity Matrix with ERO features a glass front to provide increased ruggedness and optical performance for applications in public spaces or interactive touch. The glass surface is optically bonded to the front of the LCD with a proprietary construction and technique which maintains the narrow bezel spacing and creates a continuous surface when tiled together in a video wall. Clarity Matrix with ERO also provides improved optical performance in high ambient light by providing additional ambient light rejection and increased contrast."||DVI (Dual Link)|DVI|Display, documentation|3500:1||Digital Visual Interface (DVI)||46 in|['LED-backlit', 'LCD']|Widescreen||||||||||1920 x 1080|||||"(2) Dual-Link DVI (in, out)

The Samsung Smart Signage Platform (SSSP) is embedded within Samsung displays, providing the power of a dual-core CPU and a combination of media player and integrated display solution, MagicInfo Premium S player. The solution eliminates the need for additional PC modules while reducing installation and maintenance issues. Using the included MagicInfo Premium S player, businesses can create, schedule, and deploy content effortlessly. Multiple types of content can be streamed simultaneously and continuously courtesy of the dual-core CPU and 8GB of storage, and a high performance video processor integrated on a single chip. Save more by paying less for a display integrated with a media player and premium management solution.
Adaptable and Economical Business Display:
These durable displays offer lower total cost of ownership (TCO), and are designed for continuous, energy-efficient operation with reduced power consumption and heat emission. The PE Series LFDs incorporate an innovative backlight unit (BLU), saving more electricity than traditional devices and lowering operational expenditure. This LED technology also reduces environmental impact by cutting out potentially harmful substances such as mercury, halogen and lead, as does the spray-free injection molding used to produce flat panel displays.
24/7 Performance with Enhanced Quality:
A diverse range of businesses can optimise the appearance of their content and image with the PE Series, improving key messages and offering a unified brand identity. Its slim bezel and edge-LED technology offer high brightness, with an enhanced luminescence of 700nit. The viewing experience is further improved by an anti-glare, anti-glossy panel. The PE Series represent highly durable displays that are designed for operation 24/7 in a variety of challenging environments.
Easy Installation and Efficient Space Usage:
Improve business display management with the slim, lightweight design of the Samsung PE Series. This attractive LFD ensures easy installation and improved space management, leaving more room available for other purposes. Content can be delivered to heights of up to 15m thanks to the DisplayPort feature. Furthermore, remote control is ensured by RJ45 port utilisation, even when users are combining RJ45 and RS-232 connections.
Slim and Lightweight for Flexible Installation:
The PE Series has an extremely slim depth, which is 73 per cent reduced compared to traditional products, giving a sleeker overall appearance.

"Buy Planar 46"" LX46HD-L Full LED-LCD Monitor, Black Monitors - Large-Format LED-LCD 997-7111-00 today at PC Connection"|58.00 lb(s)|||450 nit(s)|Black||"Unique Architecture and Benefits by Design:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System was architected and developed by video wall industry experts in a way that specifically addresses the challenges faced by all video wall installations: mounting and alignment, reliability and extended operation, service and maintenance access and simple, effective image processing and management. At the heart of the Clarity Matrix architecture is a distributed design that takes heat, complexity and unreliability out from behind the LCD panel and replaces it with a centrally located, easily accessible and highly reliable rackmounted system.
EasyAxis Mounting System:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System includes the EasyAxis mounting system. The EasyAxis mounting system is designed to be attached to a wall, used with optional free-standing bases or secured overhead in a flying configuration. The single mount supports all these configurations. When used in wall-mount
configuration, horizontal and vertical connection brackets ensure that each mount is perfectly spaced from its neighbor in the video wall. The mount system also incorporates a service mode to accommodate front and rear in-wall repair of any LCD module in the video wall. EasyAxis mounts are designed to facilitate the thinnest profile LCD video wall in the market. The combination of the mount plus the Clarity Matrix LCD Modules “blade” design result in video walls that measure a mere 3.6 inches in depth, screen-to-wall, as opposed to other designs that require 60% more clearance.
Precise Panel Alignment:
Clarity Matrix LCD modules incorporate a single simple interface board designed to distribute off-board power, video and control signals to the LCD panel keeping depth, weight, heat and points of potential failure to an unprecedented minimum. The LCD blade-style module incorporates a bracket that is perfectly paired with the EasyAxis mount. The LCD module includes EasyAxis adjustment cams that facilitate precise 6-axis alignment ensuring uniform, minimized image-to-image gap. The lighter design of the Clarity Matrix LCD module means that handling, installation, alignment and service are all easier to accomplish.
24x7 Operation and Simplified Maintenance:
The unique Clarity Matrix architecture provides for 24x7 operation with optimized thermal design, high-MTBF components and redundant power supply option. Because of the streamlined design of the Clarity Matrix LCD modules, fewer repairs are required at the panel itself. When the panels do need to be accessed or removed, this can be accomplished without removing other panels in the wall. Starting at the top of the wall, panels can be pulled up and out into Service Mode, allowing the panel below to be accessed. Also built into each Clarity Matrix LCD display are service and troubleshooting aids that minimize downtime in the event of a failure. Power, backlight and fan monitoring are all built into Clarity Matrix to provide failure notification. Clarity WallNet enables health and status monitoring over a customer network to proactively provide health status or send an email or text message to a service technician alerting them of a failure.
Redundant Power Supply:
The rack-mount video processing and power supply units each support 4 LCD modules, incorporate their own cooling and make configuration, maintenance and upgrades easily accessible and unobtrusive to the video wall itself. For even further reliability, the Clarity Matrix power supply unit includes an n+1 redundant design so if any one power supply in the unit fails, the remaining 4 will continue to power 4 LCD’s with uninterrupted operation.
Flexible Video Processing:
Clarity Matrix supports a wide range of processing options to display sources on the video wall. Planar’s Big Picture Plus processing is built into Clarity Matrix and allows sources to be scaled across the entire video wall or any section of the video wall. To simplify the set-up process of Big Picture Plus, Clarity Matrix has position sensors built in the LCD that determine where it is located within the array and scale the sources across the video wall automatically. Big Picture Plus processing also allows for ultra-high resolution dual link DVI signals to be input and spread over multiple displays at native resolution. For more complex configurations, Clarity Matrix supports all leading image processing and digital signage software solutions including Planar’s Indisys image processing."||DVI (Dual Link)|DVI|Display, documentation|3500:1||Digital Visual Interface (DVI)||46 in|['LCD', 'LED-backlit']|Widescreen||||||||||1920 x 1080|||||"(2) Dual-Link DVI (in, out)

Buy Joy Factory MagConnect Wall Cabinet Mount for iPad Air Stands & Mounts - AV MMA204 today at PC Connection|1.60 lb(s)||||Black||"Lightweight Strength:
MagConnect mounts are built of high-quality carbon fiber arms. This advanced material is surprisingly lightweight yet incredibly strong. The powerful combination of carbon fiber with carefully designed joints produces mounts that are both easy to maneuver and sturdy to use.
Spherical Joints:
MagConnect mounts come equipped with spherical joints for ultimate customizability. The included MagConnect iPad holder can be swiveled 360° to easily transition from portrait to landscape mode without removing it from the mount. And the sturdy carbon fiber arms can also be adjusted into infinite configurations providing you with the perfect angle every time.
Magnetic Personality:
The MagConnect locking mechanism is the next step in the evolution of mobile mounts. The technology is advanced, but using it is quite simple. First, the iPad is secured into a hard-shell case equipped with a powerful magnet. When the case is attached to a compatible product, another magnet instantly interlocks your MagConnect shell with a receiver, while a precision screw tightens for a secure fit.

Samsung’s newest Touch of Colour design is sure to command attention. Upholding Samsung’s ToC design legacy, the SD390 was crafted to catch the light of its surroundings in various beautiful ways, but brings a narrow bezel, slim and sleek black body and transparent neck to create a sophisticated and tasteful look that’s finished off perfectly with a subtle hint of soft pure blue along the bezel – making this unique monitor illuminate light and stand out in a way you’ve never seen before.
See more with style and functionality:
On or off, the stylish SD390 is sure to stand out wherever it is. Its narrow bezel design lets you see more of the screen while illuminating a subtle hint of soft pure blue that sets an elegant glow around the monitor. Its transparent crystal neck gently gleams in the light with a beautiful touch of blue and raises the screen to the perfect viewing level. The tilt feature increases your field of vision and maximises your viewing comfort. The SD390 will no doubt fulfill your every design desire.
Enhance your gaming experience with just one button:
Get perfect viewing for games with just one touch of a button. Game Mode adjusts your monitor’s settings instantly to give you an optimised gaming experience. Game Mode smartly detects the changes in scenes, enhances the colour and alters the screen’s contrast to make dark spots darker and light spots lighter so you can see all the action at all times. There is less lag thanks to a faster video response time that ensures that the picture keeps up with action and won’t let you down.
Be entertained from every angle:
Get the best view from any angle with the SD390. Unlike conventional monitors, your Samsung LED Monitor has an extra-wide viewing angle of 178 degrees, vertically and horizontally. This means great picture quality from even more perspectives – whether you’re sitting down low and playing games or if several people are sitting around the monitor to watch a video. Whatever the situation, you can enjoy great viewing.
Upscale your view with better quality and picture:
Magic Upscale improves image quality to such a level that you will only receive a better picture. Enjoy enhanced image quality no matter what the original picture quality is. Magic Upscale prevents image degradation when scaling up and gives only brilliant and pristine colours and images. And it also makes images on the monitor appear clearer and sharper than on a notebook. Shine with the SD360.
Versatile connectivity to handle multiple devices and content:
The Samsung SD390 monitor gives you all the connections you need to make the most of all your entertainment and other content. HDMI compatibility gives you access to games consoles, Blu-ray players and other AV devices, while a D-Sub connection mean you can plug in most PCs. You can easily connect your devices and use the monitor for working, gaming, viewing content and more.

For an immersive, flexible video wall solution that can be configured in many ways and appears nearly seamless, the Clarity Matrix LCD Video Wall System is the ultimate display solution for control room or digital signage applications. Optimized for 24x7 operation, the Clarity Matrix delivers outstanding visual performance and requires minimal installation space. The Clarity Matrix utilizes cutting-edge ultra-narrow bezel LCD's that when tiled result in image-to-image gaps as small as 5.7mm. Featuring a unique mounting system and mission-critical off-board electronics design, the Clarity Matrix is the slimmest and most reliable LCD video wall available.
Unique Architecture & Benefits by Design:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System was architected and developed by video wall industry experts in a way that specifically addresses the challenges faced by all video wall installations: mounting and alignment, reliability and extended operation, service and maintenance access and simple, effective image processing and management. At the heart of the Clarity Matrix architecture is a distributed design that takes heat, complexity and unreliability out from behind the LCD panel and replaces it with a centrally located, easily accessible and highly reliable rackmounted system.
EasyAxis Mounting System:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System includes the EasyAxis mounting system. The EasyAxis mounting system is designed to be attached to a wall, used with optional free-standing bases or secured overhead in a flying configuration. The single mount supports all these configurations. When used in wall-mount
configuration, horizontal and vertical connection brackets ensure that each mount is perfectly spaced from its neighbor in the video wall. The mount system also incorporates a service mode to accommodate front and rear in-wall repair of any LCD module in the video wall. EasyAxis mounts are designed to facilitate the thinnest profile LCD video wall in the market. The combination of the mount plus the Clarity Matrix LCD Modules “blade” design result in video walls that measure a mere 3.6 inches in depth, screen-to-wall, as opposed to other designs that require 60% more clearance.
Precise Panel Alignment:
Clarity Matrix LCD modules incorporate a single simple interface board designed to distribute off-board power, video and control signals to the LCD panel keeping depth, weight, heat and points of potential failure to an unprecedented minimum. The LCD blade-style module incorporates a bracket that is perfectly paired with the EasyAxis mount. The LCD module includes EasyAxis adjustment cams that facilitate precise 6-axis alignment ensuring uniform, minimized image-to-image gap. The lighter design of the Clarity Matrix LCD module means that handling, installation, alignment and service are all easier to accomplish.
24x7 Operation & Simplified Maintenance:
The unique Clarity Matrix architecture provides for 24x7 operation with optimized thermal design, high-MTBF components and redundant power supply option. Because of the streamlined design of the Clarity Matrix LCD modules, fewer repairs are required at the panel itself. When the panels do need to be accessed or removed, this can be accomplished without removing other panels in the wall. Starting at the top of the wall, panels can be pulled up and out into Service Mode, allowing the panel below to be accessed. Also built into each Clarity Matrix LCD display are service and troubleshooting aids that minimize downtime in the event of a failure. Power, backlight and fan monitoring are all built into Clarity Matrix to provide failure notification. Clarity WallNet enables health and status monitoring over a customer network to proactively provide health status or send an email or text message to a service technician alerting them of a failure.
Redundant Power Supply:
The rack-mount video processing and power supply units each support 4 LCD modules, incorporate their own cooling and make configuration, maintenance and upgrades easily accessible and unobtrusive to the video wall itself. For even further reliability, the Clarity Matrix power supply unit includes an n+1 redundant design so if any one power supply in the unit fails, the remaining 4 will continue to power 4 LCD’s with uninterrupted operation.
Flexible Video Processing:
Clarity Matrix supports a wide range of processing options to display sources on the video wall. Planar’s Big Picture Plus processing is built into Clarity Matrix and allows sources to be scaled across the entire video wall or any section of the video wall. To simplify the set-up process of Big Picture Plus, Clarity Matrix has position sensors built in the LCD that determine where it is located within the array and scale the sources across the video wall automatically. Big Picture Plus processing also allows for ultra-high resolution dual link DVI signals to be input and spread over multiple displays at native resolution. For more complex configurations, Clarity Matrix supports all leading image processing and digital signage software solutions including Planar’s Indisys image processing."|['FCC Class A certified', 'RoHS']|['DVI (Dual Link)', 'Power', 'DVI']|['Power', 'DVI']|Monitor, documentation|3500:1||Digital Visual Interface (DVI)||55 in|['LCD', 'LED-backlit']|Widescreen||||||||||1920 x 1080|||||"(4) DVI

Buy Joy Factory Tournez Tripod MagConnect for iPad Stands & Mounts - AV MMA102 today at PC Connection|2.00 lb(s)||||Black||"Lightweight Strength:
Tournez mounts are built of high-quality carbon fiber arms. This advanced material is surprisingly lightweight yet incredibly strong. The powerful combination of carbon fiber with carefully designed joints produces mounts that are both easy to maneuver and sturdy to use.
Spherical Joints:
Tournez mounts come equipped with spherical joints for ultimate customizability. The included MagConnect iPad holder can be swiveled 360° to easily transition from portrait to landscape mode without removing it from the mount. And the sturdy carbon fiber arms can also be adjusted into infinite configurations providing you with the perfect angle every time.
Magnetic Personality:
The MagConnect locking mechanism is the next step in the evolution of mobile mounts. The technology is advanced, but using it is quite simple. First, the iPad is secured into a hard-shell case equipped with a powerful magnet. When the case is attached to a compatible product, another magnet instantly interlocks your MagConnect shell with a receiver, while a precision screw tightens for a secure fit.
Beautiful On and Off its Pedestal:
When your iPad is not mounted, you can carry it in style. The MagConnect hard-shell case is textured for stunning look and feel and comes complete with a low-profile cap to cover the magnetic connector. The included case is designed to work seamlessly with the Apple Smart Cover, or for greater protection pair it with our Folio360 III, the most customizable iPad case anywhere.
Compatible with: the new iPad (3rd Gen.) & iPad2, standard 1/4""-20 tripod connections, standard 5/8""-27 mic stands."||||mount, holder, documentation||||||||||||||||||||||||iPad stand|||||||||['iPad 2', 'iPad', 'iPad 3']|||1 Year|1 Year||

For an immersive, flexible video wall solution that can be configured in many ways and appears nearly seamless, the Clarity Matrix LCD Video Wall System is the ultimate display solution for control room or digital signage applications. Optimized for 24x7 operation, the Clarity Matrix delivers outstanding visual performance and requires minimal installation space. The Clarity Matrix utilizes cutting-edge ultra-narrow bezel LCD's that when tiled result in image-to-image gaps as small as 5.7mm. Featuring a unique mounting system and mission-critical off-board electronics design, the Clarity Matrix is the slimmest and most reliable LCD video wall available.
Unique Architecture & Benefits by Design:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System was architected and developed by video wall industry experts in a way that specifically addresses the challenges faced by all video wall installations: mounting and alignment, reliability and extended operation, service and maintenance access and simple, effective image processing and management. At the heart of the Clarity Matrix architecture is a distributed design that takes heat, complexity and unreliability out from behind the LCD panel and replaces it with a centrally located, easily accessible and highly reliable rackmounted system.
EasyAxis Mounting System:
The Clarity Matrix Video Wall System includes the EasyAxis mounting system. The EasyAxis mounting system is designed to be attached to a wall, used with optional free-standing bases or secured overhead in a flying configuration. The single mount supports all these configurations. When used in wall-mount
configuration, horizontal and vertical connection brackets ensure that each mount is perfectly spaced from its neighbor in the video wall. The mount system also incorporates a service mode to accommodate front and rear in-wall repair of any LCD module in the video wall. EasyAxis mounts are designed to facilitate the thinnest profile LCD video wall in the market. The combination of the mount plus the Clarity Matrix LCD Modules “blade” design result in video walls that measure a mere 3.6 inches in depth, screen-to-wall, as opposed to other designs that require 60% more clearance.
Precise Panel Alignment:
Clarity Matrix LCD modules incorporate a single simple interface board designed to distribute off-board power, video and control signals to the LCD panel keeping depth, weight, heat and points of potential failure to an unprecedented minimum. The LCD blade-style module incorporates a bracket that is perfectly paired with the EasyAxis mount. The LCD module includes EasyAxis adjustment cams that facilitate precise 6-axis alignment ensuring uniform, minimized image-to-image gap. The lighter design of the Clarity Matrix LCD module means that handling, installation, alignment and service are all easier to accomplish.
24x7 Operation & Simplified Maintenance:
The unique Clarity Matrix architecture provides for 24x7 operation with optimized thermal design, high-MTBF components and redundant power supply option. Because of the streamlined design of the Clarity Matrix LCD modules, fewer repairs are required at the panel itself. When the panels do need to be accessed or removed, this can be accomplished without removing other panels in the wall. Starting at the top of the wall, panels can be pulled up and out into Service Mode, allowing the panel below to be accessed. Also built into each Clarity Matrix LCD display are service and troubleshooting aids that minimize downtime in the event of a failure. Power, backlight and fan monitoring are all built into Clarity Matrix to provide failure notification. Clarity WallNet enables health and status monitoring over a customer network to proactively provide health status or send an email or text message to a service technician alerting them of a failure.
Redundant Power Supply:
The rack-mount video processing and power supply units each support 4 LCD modules, incorporate their own cooling and make configuration, maintenance and upgrades easily accessible and unobtrusive to the video wall itself. For even further reliability, the Clarity Matrix power supply unit includes an n+1 redundant design so if any one power supply in the unit fails, the remaining 4 will continue to power 4 LCD’s with uninterrupted operation.
Flexible Video Processing:
Clarity Matrix supports a wide range of processing options to display sources on the video wall. Planar’s Big Picture Plus processing is built into Clarity Matrix and allows sources to be scaled across the entire video wall or any section of the video wall. To simplify the set-up process of Big Picture Plus, Clarity Matrix has position sensors built in the LCD that determine where it is located within the array and scale the sources across the video wall automatically. Big Picture Plus processing also allows for ultra-high resolution dual link DVI signals to be input and spread over multiple displays at native resolution. For more complex configurations, Clarity Matrix supports all leading image processing and digital signage software solutions including Planar’s Indisys image processing.
Clarity Matrix with ERO:
Clarity Matrix with ERO features a glass front to provide increased ruggedness and optical performance for applications in public spaces or interactive touch. The glass surface is optically bonded to the front of the LCD with a proprietary construction and technique which maintains the narrow bezel spacing and creates a continuous surface when tiled together in a video wall. Clarity Matrix with ERO also provides improved optical performance in high ambient light by providing additional ambient light rejection and increased contrast."||['DVI (Dual Link)', 'Power', 'DVI']|['Power', 'DVI']|Monitor, documentation|3500:1||Digital Visual Interface (DVI)||46 in|['LCD', 'LED-backlit']|Widescreen||||||||||1920 x 1080|||||"(4) DVI

The Samsung Smart Signage Platform (SSSP) is embedded within Samsung displays, providing the power of a dual-core CPU and a combination of media player and integrated display solution, MagicInfo Premium S player. The solution eliminates the need for additional PC modules while reducing installation and maintenance issues. Using the included MagicInfo Premium S player, businesses can create, schedule, and deploy content effortlessly. Multiple types of content can be streamed simultaneously and continuously courtesy of the dual-core CPU and 8GB of storage, and a high performance video processor integrated on a single chip. Save more by paying less for a display integrated with a media player and premium management solution.
Adaptable and Economical Business Display:
These durable displays offer lower total cost of ownership (TCO), and are designed for continuous, energy-efficient operation with reduced power consumption and heat emission. The PE Series LFDs incorporate an innovative backlight unit (BLU), saving more electricity than traditional devices and lowering operational expenditure. This LED technology also reduces environmental impact by cutting out potentially harmful substances such as mercury, halogen and lead, as does the spray-free injection molding used to produce flat panel displays.
24/7 Performance with Enhanced Quality:
A diverse range of businesses can optimise the appearance of their content and image with the PE Series, improving key messages and offering a unified brand identity. Its slim bezel and edge-LED technology offer high brightness, with an enhanced luminescence of 700nit. The viewing experience is further improved by an anti-glare, anti-glossy panel. The PE Series represent highly durable displays that are designed for operation 24/7 in a variety of challenging environments.
Easy Installation and Efficient Space Usage:
Improve business display management with the slim, lightweight design of the Samsung PE Series. This attractive LFD ensures easy installation and improved space management, leaving more room available for other purposes. Content can be delivered to heights of up to 15m thanks to the DisplayPort feature. Furthermore, remote control is ensured by RJ45 port utilisation, even when users are combining RJ45 and RS-232 connections.
Slim and Lightweight for Flexible Installation:
The PE Series has an extremely slim depth, which is 73 per cent reduced compared to traditional products, giving a sleeker overall appearance. The lightweight design frees up more space and leads to easier, more efficient installation. A narrow bezel increases viewer focus on content and allows more room for information display. It also enables virtually seamless video walls for a more immersive experience.

This display features a frameless solid flush mount surface without conventional ridged bezel. The thin profile also blends seamlessly with the panel for an ultra-high tech look to complement any home setting. The sleek seamless touch sensitive controls provide a simple and intuitive operating experience.
Save Cash and Save the Planet:
With its mercury free backlight and low energy consumption, the ENERGY STAR 5.0 certified VX2370Smh-LED is not only environmentally friendly but also friendly on your electricity bill as well. This can add up to thousands of dollars saved for large install bases, such as big corporate buildings or schools, the savings can be as dramatic as $20, 000 in five years.
Mega Dynamic Contrast Ratio:
One of the great features of VX2370Smh-LED is its ability to dim the backlight completely for pure darkness during dark scenes such as a night shot in a movie. Contrast ratios refer to the ratio of the brightest color to the darkest color. With traditional CCFL backlit displays, contrast ratios are limited to the fluorescent lamp’s ability to dim in order to reproduce darkness. However, with the LED backlight, each LED has the ability to completely shut off allowing for a near infinite ratio of black to white contrast. The end result is true blacks that result in greater overall image quality.
Full HD 1080p Resolution:
The VA2451m-LED features a 24""(23.6” viewable) widescreen with 1920x1080 resolution is capable of displaying a native Full HD 1080p image. Today, devices that can display Full HD content output are getting more and more common. However, without a native Full HD display, you will not be able to experience the picture clarity and the details of the 1080p content you view.
