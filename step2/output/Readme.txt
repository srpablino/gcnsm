You will need to download and de-compress these files to run the example experiments:

Graph with fasttext-encoded features for the monitor-attribute_matching experiment:
Download https://storage.googleapis.com/embeddings_storage/step2/output/monitor.zip
Graph with fasttext-encoded features for the openML-dataset_similarity experiment:
